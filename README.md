# Ford-Fulkerson

1. How to Run the Algorithm :

   There are total 2 files in the algorithm the first file is SourceSinkGenerator and other is Ford_Fulkerson.
   1. SourceSinkGenerator : It is used to generate the graph and find the source and sink node. You should provide the n, r and uppercap values inside the main method of it.
   2. Ford_Fulkerson : It has all 4 algorithms including the normal Ford fulkerson algorithm.
   3. source_sink_graph.csv : It is a csv file that store the necessary information about the graph.

   first you should run the SourceSinkGenerator and then run the Ford_Fulkerson.
   But, if you have already given the source_sink_graph.csv file then you can directly run the Ford_Fulkerson.java file.
